# S3
Infinite scaling storage

## Buckets
- directories
- globally unique name
- defined at region level, looks like a global service

## Objects
- objects (files) has a key
- key is the full path:
    - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
    - prefix + object name
- no concept of directories in S3

- VALUE: content of the body
    - max obj size if 5k GB = 5T

- Metadata
    - list of key/value pair, sys or user

- Tags

- Version ID

- folders/files

## Security

- User based
    - IAM policy

- Resource based
    - bucket policies
    - Access Control List (ACL)
        - object ACL

- Bucket policies is Json based

## Website Static hosting

## Replication
- Cross Region
- Same Region
- must enable versioning
- async 
- lifecyle rules can be used to define when S3 object to be move to another storage class or delete after times


## Storage class
- General
- IA infrequent access
- one zone-infreq (1 az, otherwise >=3)
- glacier Intstant Retrieval
- glacier flexible Retrieval
- glacier deep archive
- intelligent tiering

### durablity: 9's

### availiablity, 99/99% 

### iam access analyzer for s3
- evaluate s3 bucket policer, s3 acls

## Shared Res
- aws: global security, durability, scaliability
- user: versioning, policies, replication, log and monitor. storage class

## Snowball
- Edge devices
- data migration, shipment, import export
- data transfer in is Free

## AWS Storage Gatway
- part of on-perm and part of on cloud
- but s3 is propertiery
- file gateway, volume gateway, tape gateway, bridge on-perm data to s3/ebs
